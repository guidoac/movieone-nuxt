<p align="center">
  This project has the purpose to improve my portfolio and to learn techniques using <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">NuxtJS</a>. THIS IS NOT A REAL PROJECT.
  <br>
  Movieone is an stream platform that you can watch and see different lists of movies and TV series. You can discover and view data from many different movies and series.
  <br>
  My idea was to search in many different graphic design hubs for a real nice and beautiful project, with a modern UI/UX to replicate and turn it into something usable and animated.
</p>

<br>

## Overview
<p>
  As i said before, i was searching in many different graphic design hubs, a project to turn into something usable. This project should be very beautiful, with a modern design and (off course) should be something possible to make.
</p>

<p>
  So i found <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/125199355/Movie-stream-platform-UI"> this project </a> on Behance. The initial idea of this project consists in become a online platform that allows you to watch your favorite movies (like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc...).
</p>

<p>
  I don't have a plan to turn this into a real project and (for example) turn possible to watch media, or create account, make login, and things that can use a backend framework or something similar.
  <br>
  My purpose with this project is just to build the front-end using the newest techniques, conventions and libraries that i can.
</p>

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Technical stuff

Libraries, techniques, conventions, and all technical stuff that i used and were needed to build this project.

### `Database`

I used The Movie DB API to build this project, it was necessary to handle with a big amount of data and to have in my hands a big catalog of movies and TV series.

Click <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3">here</a> for The Movie DB docs.

### `Nuxt`

Library that i used for the front end and basically i built this project to learn Nuxt and its features. This library helped me a lot to build this project, its automated router according to your folder structure, conventions, auto import components, SSR/SSG alternatives and many other features.

Click <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">here</a> for the Nuxt docs.

### `Vue.js`

Behind Nuxt, there is a lib that i love so much, i'm a Vue.js admirer. Mainly this project was built with Vue.js and its features, i already know many this about Vue, but we never stop learning new things. This project was built with Vue 2.

Click <a href="https://vuejs.org/">here</a> for the Vue.js docs.

### `Vuex`

I used Vuex to manage data inside the application.

Click <a href="">here</a> for the Vuex docs.

### `Vue Router`

I used the default Vue Router contained in Nuxt.

Click <a href="https://router.vuejs.org/">here</a> for the Vue Router docs.

### `BootstrapVue`

I used a component library called BootstrapVue, that allows me to work with Bootstrap using Vue components.

Click <a href="https://bootstrap-vue.org/">here</a> for the BootstrapVue docs.

### `Vue Slick Carousel`

I used Vue Slick carousel to build all the carousels in the website. This library allows me to modify many things (aesthetically), so i thought this lib works very well for this project.

Click <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-slick-carousel">here</a> for the Vue Slick Carousel docs.

### `Webpack`

I used Webpack (could not be another) to bundle all my assets.

Click <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">here</a> for the Webpack docs.

### `Vue Style Guide`

I used Vue Style Guide to follow conventions, avoid errors, avoid anti-patterns, and follow many rules that turn my Vue code clean and easier to mantain.

Click <a href="https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/?redirect=true">here</a> for the Vue Style Guide docs.

### `Vue Style Guidist`

I used Vue Style Guidist to document all my Vue components, methods, computed methods, mixins, plugins, Vuex Actions, Vuex Getters, Vuex Mutations and many others Vue-based features.

Click <a href="https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/">here</a> for the Vue Style Guidist docs.
